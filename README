Fontfinder is a Blender addon that lets you find and load fonts by
entering patterns using Fontconfig
<https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/>, the standard
Linux font-matching API. I find this more convenient than having to
navigate to directories containing font files; just type a short
string that is sufficient to identify the font that you want.

The enclosed summary document was created as an SVG file. You can
convert it to another format, e.g. PDF, using an Inkscape command like

    inkscape docs/summary.svg --export-pdf=summary.pdf
